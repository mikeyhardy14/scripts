**Subject:** Question About SharePoint Migration Process  

Hi Sean,  

I hope you're doing well.  

I have a question regarding the migration to SharePoint. Weâ€™re currently in the process of building out the directory and have been gathering feedback from POCs and executives. Based on our conversation on Friday, I understand that you have experience with similar migrations.  

Once the directory is set up, could you clarify the process for migrating files for each group? Any guidance or best practices you can share would be greatly appreciated.  

Looking forward to your insights.  

Best regards,
